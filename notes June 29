Contracts data added
Who has worst contract?
What types of players are the most valuable?


Main problem:

- Study on intangeble metrics: Clutch Gene!

	- Need to understand a player’s role
		-classifying player types
		- identified that offence and defence should be separated
	- When are there high pressure situations?
		- i.e. when do players of specific roles experience a reduction in ability?
	- How well do specific players perform in these high pressure situations? 

Finished so far:
- Classifying offensive players, and identified high pressure situations for them.
- Example (show Gordon hayward, Kyle Lowry and Derozan shot types)
	- GH and KL are quite close when a nearest neighbour search is applied
- Show pressure DD, KL
	- not quite as strong under pressure
